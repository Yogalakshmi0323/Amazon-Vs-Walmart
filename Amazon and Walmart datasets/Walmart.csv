1,1,The customer service is very bad. I bought a Breville Barista Pro espresso machine for 468$ which is too cheap because the machine's price is 850$. The third-party seller was a scammer. He puts low prices to attract buyers. He sent me a tracking number to the same city as my address but to a different address and sent a small box that fit a mailbox. The machine is about 30 pounds. I called the USPS and they told me that the tracking number was not to my address. So Walmart charged me 468$ and later they removed that seller from their site due to quality issues (that means he is a scammer). 
2,1,"I have attempted to put this review on Walmart.com but it indicates I have been 'opted out'. I purchased Binax covid tests online to pick up at store. Good product. Product is FIVE STARS, online shopping experience is ONE STAR. Online order Sunday 8/27/23 with Store pickup on Monday 8/28/23 around 2pm. I am reviewing to caution other online shoppers to ALWAYS scroll down before adding ANY item to their WalMart cart because the NOTICE if something is not returnable isn't visible unless you do. I picked up my order on the way out of town, and only later saw that the expiration dates were all close enough that I NEVER would have purchased the same amount of tests had I been shopping in-store. So I clicked 'start a return' on my receipt and only then found out I had purchased something non-refundable."
3,1,I have been a Walmart plus member for years now and well how this all played out has really left me in shock. Due to their errors and failure to fulfill my orders they have closed my acct due to me refusing to pay for items I didn't receive. Before I moved to my new place I rarely had any issue with the walmart delivery but once I moved it seemed like every order there was more and more items missing. 
4,1,"I refused a living room set that they sent one week ahead of schedule. I refused it while there was still one week left to the delivery date. They brought it one week ahead of schedule and then charged me a $155 'shipping return and restocking fee' saying it was the buyer's fault. It took Walmart 3 weeks and numerous phone calls to finally give me a refund of $665 out of my $1038 return. Their customer service said I need to call their Angi living room assembly service separately to get my assembly refund of $194. This was inspite of the fact that Angie sent me a cancellation email the day after I returned it saying Walmart will refund me directly. Each Walmart agent thereafter kept giving me different numbers to call Angie. When I finally called the 'right number', no one picked up. Will NEVER order anything from Walmart again!!"
5,1,"Beware!! Practices discriminatory/preferential order fulfillment and refuses to correct actions taken against customers!! Don't bother thinking the time your order is due, that you placed it first, or that they took your money matters!! This store fills orders in whatever order they like and refuse to communicate in any way outside of automated emails that say nothing substantial and offer no real solutions!! Management hides from customers and nobody picks up at any extension!! Save yourself headache and shop at another site or elsewhere entirely!! May be coordinating a class action due to their behaviors."
6,1,"I have spent hours on the phone with no resolution since Sunday. I'm done paying for Walmart Plus and in home when I rarely get my stuff when I'm supposed to. I had to do their job in my opinion. Why should I have to fix the stores mess up? Why should I pay on time every month and not get the service I pay for? This irritated me, not only because I didn't get my order but because of the lack of effort and knowledge by the customer service representative (except for 1 that actually called the store). Bottom line is, I pay for a service, I should be provided with that service or I should be fully refunded for that service. My order was supposed to arrive between 2-6 on 8/13/23. I get a call from them at 8 telling me the van ran out of battery. Ok, then use a gas vehicle. Not only did it come up that they ""attempted"" to deliver it, but they don't even reschedule or even try to accommodate. I wasted hours trying to resolve this."
7,1,"Reading the previous complaints, I can only concur with Walmart+ membership service in general. It’s obvious that customer service representatives are located overseas and speak broken English for starters. Why? They are trained for niceties, in the hopes to quell the poor services, it serves no purpose if the simple question why my promised delivery twice in one week did not appear. Insult to injury, I contacted the local Walmart where the delivery was coming from (1.2 miles away) the operator told me there was no store manager that I can speak to, and referred to the online customer service representative. "
8,1,"While it may be difficult to not shop at Walmart due to their obviously very competitive prices versus their competitors, the reason they are able to do this is because they cut corners everywhere else. Whether it’s the terrible conditions for their employees, or the overseas labor they use as their supposed customer service department, that don’t speak English and respond only with automated scripted answers, or the lack of any type of sales support at all once the initial purchase is completed, until we as consumers stop giving them our billions of dollars each and every year, you can expect to continue to receive the same 1 star treatment as evidenced by the thousands of reviews posted here and elsewhere."
9,1,"I updated my phone number and I was trying to log into my account to update the information on my Walmart account. It showed that a OTP was sent to my old number which I don't have any longer. I called support and spoke with 2 reps and a supervisor. They told me that since I do not have access to the old number I would need to create a new account. The catch is that I cannot use my email address, I would have to create another account with a different email address. When I told them I don't have another email address they said there is nothing that they could do. Basically, they are saying they no longer want my business. Also since my credit card information is on my account that I cannot access, if my account gets hacked, Walmart will be responsible for the loss. I will never shop Walmart again."
10,1,"I bought a 75 inch tv online using Walmart. Right after buying the tv, my bank card was hacked and charged $700 after I just bought a tv using Walmart online. Never use your bank card. ALWAYS use a prepaid card when buying online."

It took Walmart 3 weeks and numerous phone calls to finally give me a refund of $665 out of my $1038 return.

56,1,"I have spent hours on the phone with no resolution since Sunday. I'm done paying for Walmart Plus and in home when I rarely get my stuff when I'm supposed to. I had to do their job in my opinion. Why should I have to fix the stores mess up? Why should I pay on time every month and not get the service I pay for? This irritated me, not only because I didn't get my order but because of the lack of effort and knowledge by the customer service representative (except for 1 that actually called the store). Bottom line is, I pay for a service, I should be provided with that service or I should be fully refunded for that service. My order was supposed to arrive between 2-6 on 8/13/23. I get a call from them at 8 telling me the van ran out of battery. Ok, then use a gas vehicle. Not only did it come up that they ""attempted"" to deliver it, but they don't even reschedule or even try to accommodate. I wasted hours trying to resolve this."
57,1,"Reading the previous complaints, I can only concur with Walmart+ membership service in general.

They are trained for niceties, in the hopes to quell the poor services, it serves no purpose if the simple question why my promised delivery twice in one week did not appear.

106,1,"I have spent hours on the phone with no resolution since Sunday. I'm done paying for Walmart Plus and in home when I rarely get my stuff when I'm supposed to. I had to do their job in my opinion. Why should I have to fix the stores mess up? Why should I pay on time every month and not get the service I pay for? This irritated me, not only because I didn't get my order but because of the lack of effort and knowledge by the customer service representative (except for 1 that actually called the store). Bottom line is, I pay for a service, I should be provided with that service or I should be fully refunded for that service. My order was supposed to arrive between 2-6 on 8/13/23. I get a call from them at 8 telling me the van ran out of battery. Ok, then use a gas vehicle. Not only did it come up that they ""attempted"" to deliver it, but they don't even reschedule or even try to accommodate. I wasted hours trying to resolve this."

This irritated me, not only because I didn't get my order but because of the lack of effort and knowledge by the customer service representative (except for 1 that actually called the store). Bottom line is, I pay for a service, I should be provided with that service or I should be fully refunded for that service. My order was supposed to arrive between 2-6 on 8/13/23.

161,1,The customer service is very bad. I bought a Breville Barista Pro espresso machine for 468$ which is too cheap because the machine's price is 850$. The third-party seller was a scammer.

The catch is that I cannot use my email address, I would have to create another account with a different email address. When I told them I don't have another email address they said there is nothing that they could do. Basically, they are saying they no longer want my business. Also since my credit card information is on my account that I cannot access, if my account gets hacked, Walmart will be responsible for the loss. I will never shop Walmart again."
210,1,"I bought a 75 inch tv online using Walmart. Right after buying the tv, my bank card was hacked and charged $700 after I just bought a tv using Walmart online. Never use your bank card. ALWAYS use a prepaid card when buying online."
211,1,The customer service is very bad. I bought a Breville Barista Pro espresso machine for 468$ which is too cheap because the machine's price is 850$. The third-party seller was a scammer. He puts low prices to attract buyers. He sent me a tracking number to the same city as my address but to a different address and sent a small box that fit a mailbox. The machine is about 30 pounds. I called the USPS and they told me that the tracking number was not to my address. So Walmart charged me 468$ and later they removed that seller from their site due to quality issues (that means he is a scammer).

I am reviewing to caution other online shoppers to ALWAYS scroll down before adding ANY item to their WalMart cart because the NOTICE if something is not returnable isn't visible unless you do. I picked up my order on the way out of town, and only later saw that the expiration dates were all close enough that I NEVER would have purchased the same amount of tests had I been shopping in-store. So I clicked 'start a return' on my receipt and only then found out I had purchased something non-refundable."

It took Walmart 3 weeks and numerous phone calls to finally give me a refund of $665 out of my $1038 return. Their customer service said I need to call their Angi living room assembly service separately to get my assembly refund of $194. This was inspite of the fact that Angie sent me a cancellation email the day after I returned it saying Walmart will refund me directly.

The catch is that I cannot use my email address, I would have to create another account with a different email address. When I told them I don't have another email address they said there is nothing that they could do. Basically, they are saying they no longer want my business. Also since my credit card information is on my account that I cannot access, if my account gets hacked, Walmart will be responsible for the loss. I will never shop Walmart again."
260,1,"I bought a 75 inch tv online using Walmart. Right after buying the tv, my bank card was hacked and charged $700 after I just bought a tv using Walmart online. Never use your bank card. ALWAYS use a prepaid card when buying online."
261,1,The customer service is very bad. I bought a Breville Barista Pro espresso machine for 468$ which is too cheap because the machine's price is 850$. The third-party seller was a scammer. He puts low prices to attract buyers. He sent me a tracking number to the same city as my address but to a different address and sent a small box that fit a mailbox. The machine is about 30 pounds. I called the USPS and they told me that the tracking number was not to my address. So Walmart charged me 468$ and later they removed that seller from their site due to quality issues (that means he is a scammer). 
262,1,"I have attempted to put this review on Walmart.com but it indicates I have been 'opted out'. I purchased Binax covid tests online to pick up at store. Good product. Product is FIVE STARS, online shopping experience is ONE STAR. Online order Sunday 8/27/23 with Store pickup on Monday 8/28/23 around 2pm. I am reviewing to caution other online shoppers to ALWAYS scroll down before adding ANY item to their WalMart cart because the NOTICE if something is not returnable isn't visible unless you do. I picked up my order on the way out of town, and only later saw that the expiration dates were all close enough that I NEVER would have purchased the same amount of tests had I been shopping in-store. So I clicked 'start a return' on my receipt and only then found out I had purchased something non-refundable."
263,1,I have been a Walmart plus member for years now and well how this all played out has really left me in shock. Due to their errors and failure to fulfill my orders they have closed my acct due to me refusing to pay for items I didn't receive. Before I moved to my new place I rarely had any issue with the walmart delivery but once I moved it seemed like every order there was more and more items missing. 
264,1,"I refused a living room set that they sent one week ahead of schedule. I refused it while there was still one week left to the delivery date. They brought it one week ahead of schedule and then charged me a $155 'shipping return and restocking fee' saying it was the buyer's fault. It took Walmart 3 weeks and numerous phone calls to finally give me a refund of $665 out of my $1038 return. Their customer service said I need to call their Angi living room assembly service separately to get my assembly refund of $194. This was inspite of the fact that Angie sent me a cancellation email the day after I returned it saying Walmart will refund me directly. Each Walmart agent thereafter kept giving me different numbers to call Angie. When I finally called the 'right number', no one picked up. Will NEVER order anything from Walmart again!!"

266,1,"I have spent hours on the phone with no resolution since Sunday. I'm done paying for Walmart Plus and in home when I rarely get my stuff when I'm supposed to. I had to do their job in my opinion. Why should I have to fix the stores mess up? Why should I pay on time every month and not get the service I pay for? This irritated me, not only because I didn't get my order but because of the lack of effort and knowledge by the customer service representative (except for 1 that actually called the store). Bottom line is, I pay for a service, I should be provided with that service or I should be fully refunded for that service. My order was supposed to arrive between 2-6 on 8/13/23. I get a call from them at 8 telling me the van ran out of battery. Ok, then use a gas vehicle. Not only did it come up that they ""attempted"" to deliver it, but they don't even reschedule or even try to accommodate. I wasted hours trying to resolve this."
